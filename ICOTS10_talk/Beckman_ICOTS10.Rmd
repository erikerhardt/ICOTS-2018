# Notes: 

- Presentation
    - don't present the paper
    - more "detail" than paper
    - share actual patterns of examples
- Time allocation (~ 20 mins?)
    - 5 min: Intro/background of study
    - 2 min on credibility of the instrument
    - 10 min show results
    - 3-5 min conclusion


"What is ISTUDIO designed to measure?"

- Discernment of statistical questions
    - this evaluation is the first step to productive analysis
    - W & P "PPDAC" cycle (P-P phase)
- Forward & backward transfer
    - W &P "shuttling"
    - assessment is designed to isolate each direction in the shuttling process
        - (BT) context to architype
        - (FT) architype to context

"What do you learn when you ask questions like this?"


Results/Issues to discuss
1. population as a process: 
    - summarize 2 examples
    - finding: some students constructed some kind of artificial discrete/countable population 
2. lexical ambiguity/misconceptions of parameter
    - summarize 2 examples
    - finding: large variability ascribed to parameter
    - finding: "study design detail/constraint" (cite ZDM & Kaplan papers)
3. is this a statistical question?
    - summarize 2 examples
    - finding: students self-contradict... say "no" and then use inference anyway
